ana_c_ana_m.m: Plots carrier, modulator, AM, PM and FM signals in time and frequency domains.   
n_ask.m: Plots an N-level encoded modulator and the corresponding ASK in time and frequency domains.   
n_fsk.m: Plots an N-level encoded modulator and the corresponding FSK in time and freq. domains.   
sampling_test.m: Compares how signal length affects the result of the FFT accuracy.   
mag_pahse_test.m: Compares different methods to calculate and plot the magnitude and phase of a given signal.   
n_psk.m: Generates a PSK modulation and plots the modulator and the modulated signal in time as well as in the frequency domain.   
vector_gen_test.m: This file is a Matlab script that compares 2 different ways to generate a vector.   
IQmod_demod.m: This file is a Matlab script that generates IQ modulation and demodulates back to the orginal signal.   
pam.m: This file is a Matlab script that generates a PAM modulation.
pwm.m: PWM (Pulse width modulation) signal generation Matlab script.
