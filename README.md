ana_c_ana_m.m plots carrier, modulator, AM, PM and FM signals in time and frequency domains.   
n_ask.m plots an N-level encoded modulator and the corresponding ASK in time and frequency domains.   
n_fsk.m plots an N-level encoded modulator and the corresponding FSK in time and freq. domains.   
sampling_test.m compares how signal length affects the result of the FFT accuracy.   
mag_pahse_test.m compares different methods to calculate and plot the magnitude and phase of a given signal.   
n_psk.m generates a PSK modulation and plots the modulator and the modulated signal in time as well as in the frequency domain.
